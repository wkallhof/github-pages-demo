## Static Site Builder

This directory holds the content needed to build the `/docs` folder into the static site. It utilizes `11ty` as the static site builder. If you need to manage assets (css / js), you can do that in this directory in the `assets` folder. If you need to modify the layout that documents get rendered within, you can do so in the `_includes/layout.njk` folder.
